'RND(number)

'This function returns a random number between 0 and 1.
'The number parameter is usually set to 1, but the value is unimportant because it is not actually used by the function.
'The function will always return an arbitrary number between 0 and 1.

'Usage:

' print ten numbers between one and ten
for a = 1 to 10
    print int(rnd(1)*10) + 1
next a
